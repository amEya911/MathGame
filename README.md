# Math Game

**Math Game** is a 1v1 math game where you can challenge a friend or play against a bot. Both players are presented with the same math question and answer options. The screen is divided into two sections: the first player answers from the bottom section, while the second player answers from the top section. The first player to select the correct answer earns a point. If a player selects the wrong option, the opponent earns the point. 

The bot has three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) that affect the accuracy of the answers and the response time. Challenge your friends or sharpen your skills against the bot at various difficulty levels.
